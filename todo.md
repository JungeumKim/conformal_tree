- [ ] Expand on the distinction between conformal tree and the studentized residuals method with a tree modeling $\hat\sigma$ (write down what I explained to Jungeum in my note)


## Literature to check:
- [ ] Understand the similar approaches and why this has not bee n done before
- Fong and Holmes, Bayesian conformal [[https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/97785e0500ad16c18574c64189ccf4b4-Abstract.html]]
    - Check the paper and add to references
- [ ] Candes lecture on time series conformal prediction (check for overlap)
- [ ] Gibbs et al (2023) Grouping or overlapping?
- [ ] Rina paper with distribution shift and discretization

## Idea
- [ ] Think of the averaging method
- [ ] Theory for averaging method
- [ ] Think about the discontinuity


## Simulations
- [ ] Implement separate error metrics:
    - [x] Interval score length
    - Interval width
    - Coverage
- [ ] More simulation data in multidimensional setting to better understand
    - [ ] Experiment with the tree for real data
- [ ] Do quantile conformal methods for the non-filled in areas in the table
- [ ] Apply this method to studentized and cqr variants
